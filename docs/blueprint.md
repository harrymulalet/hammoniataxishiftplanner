## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of reliability and professionalism. This aligns with the need for drivers and admins to feel secure and in control of the shift scheduling process.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F0F2F5), a desaturated version of the primary hue, offers a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Choose a vibrant purple (#7E57C2), 30 degrees from the deep blue, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. This provides clear visual cues for primary actions within the app.
- Employ a clear and readable sans-serif font (like Roboto) for all text elements to ensure legibility across different screen sizes and devices.
- Utilize Material Design icons to maintain a consistent and intuitive user experience. Icons should be used to represent actions, status, and navigation.
- Adopt a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Prioritize content hierarchy and readability.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements to provide feedback and improve usability, creating a smoother, more engaging user experience.
